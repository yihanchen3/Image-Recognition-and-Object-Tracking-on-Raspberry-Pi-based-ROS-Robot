# Object Tracking Control on Ackermann Steering Car in ROS

This repository contains the code for an autonomous vehicle control built using ROS (Robot Operating System) and OpenCV on a Raspberry Pi-based Ackermann steering car. The system is designed to recognize objects, track them, and control the vehicle's movement based on marker detection and color tracking.

## Project Overview

### 1. `marker_based_control.py`

Controls the vehicle's movement by adjusting its speed and direction based on the position of a visual marker detected in its environment.

- **Marker Detection**: Processes position data from a ROS topic.
- **Movement Adjustment**: Sets linear and angular velocities to follow the markerâ€”slowing down when close, speeding up when far, and turning toward the marker.

### 2. `object_tracking_navigation.py`

Implements object tracking and navigation using OpenCV, where the vehicle follows objects of a specific color.

- **Object Detection**: Filters camera images based on a specified color range.
- **Navigation Control**: Adjusts the vehicle's speed and direction to maintain alignment and appropriate distance from the detected object.
